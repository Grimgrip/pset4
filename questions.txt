0.  BMP supports 4 billion colors. GIF supports 256 colors. JPEG supports 16.7 million colors. PNG supports 16 million colors. 
1.  GIF supports animation.
2.  The difference between lossy and lossless compression is that
3.  JPEG is lossy-compressed.
4.  The file is not actually deleted. The meta data/address table that pointed to that specific information is just overwritten.
5.  Overwrite data so the original information can not be recovered.
6.  A head file that declares a number of ints that each have specified length.
7.  Each of these represents an unsigned int of a cerain length.
8.  BYTE, 8 bytes. DWORD, 32 bytes. LONG, 32 bytes. WORD, 16 bytes.
9.  First two bytes declares bfType (file type).
10. bfSize denotes the size of the BMP file. biSize denotes the size of the struct in bytes.
11. A negative biHeight indicates that the file goes from the top to the bottom. Begins at the top left.
12. biBitCount.
13. Arguments are probably missing. No input file or no output file, maybe both.
14. Only reading one triple at a time.
15. I haven't the faintest idea.
16. Simply skips padding when reading a BMP file.
17. Int const that denotes offset for fseek.
18. Rob Bowden holding what appears to be a teddy bear? Or a cat? Not sure.
